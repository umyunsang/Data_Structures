# Data Structures in Python

## 📚 Introduction

Welcome to the **Data Structures in Python** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of common data structures implemented in Python. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking a quick reference, this repository is designed to be a valuable resource for all.

## 🌟 Features

- **Detailed Implementations**: Each data structure is implemented with clear, commented code to facilitate understanding.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples and use cases to demonstrate the application of each data structure.
- **Extensive Coverage**: From basic structures like arrays and linked lists to advanced ones like trees and graphs.
- **Educational Focus**: Aimed at learners and professionals alike to improve their coding skills and data structure knowledge.

## 📁 Structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-in-python.git
   cd data-structures-in-python
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Data Structure**

   Choose a data structure you are interested in:

   ```sh
   cd arrays
   ```

3. **Run the Examples**

   Execute the example scripts to see the data structures in action:

   ```sh
   python array_example.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

Each data structure folder contains two main files:
- The implementation file (e.g., `array.py`): This file contains the class definition and methods for the data structure.
- The example file (e.g., `array_example.py`): This file demonstrates how to use the data structure with practical examples.

## 🤝 Contributing
